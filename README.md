# abezam-cdn

🌀 A central CDN repository to host and manage CSS, JavaScript, and asset files for **Abezam** web development projects and templates.

---

## 🔥 What is this?

**abezam-cdn** is a static content delivery repository where we store all reusable frontend assets — such as:

- ✅ Global CSS stylesheets  
- ✅ Custom UI component styles  
- ✅ JavaScript utilities  
- ✅ Fonts, icons, and other CDN assets  
- ✅ Template-specific styles (per project)

These assets are meant to be served via **Netlify CDN** or other trusted hosts and used across Abezam projects without needing local copies.
